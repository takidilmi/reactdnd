# Drag-and-Drop Website Builder

This project is a simple drag-and-drop website builder built with Next.js. It allows users to create static websites by dragging and dropping text and images into a specific section of the website.

## Features

- **Drag and Drop**: Users can drag elements with the ids "myImage" and "myText" and drop them into the website section.
- **Toolbar**: The toolbar contains two elements, Text and Image, which users can drag and drop into their website.
- **Edit Content**: Users can edit the text after itâ€™s dropped into the website section. For images, users can click on the image to open a file dialog and select a new image to replace the existing one.
- **Delete Sections**: Users can delete the sections. Each dropped element has a close button that removes the wrapper containing the element when clicked.
- **Save and Load**: The current state of the website section is saved to local storage when the "Save" button is clicked. The saved state is loaded from local storage when the component mounts.
- **Generate and Dwoload**: One click to generate your creation into an HTML with its style for what you achieved.
